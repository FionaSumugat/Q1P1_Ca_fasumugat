        <p> We have the year level and where they spend their remaining allowance as the qualitative variables of our research. <br>

            <br> According to our table and graphs, most of the respondents are in the 7th grade, taking over 46% of the sample with a frequency of 23. Next are the 9th graders, taking over 28% of the sample with a frequency of 14, 9 values less than the 7th graders. Next are the 11th graders with 24% & a frequency of 12, and 8th graders with 2% and a frequency of 1. <br> 
            
            <br> Overall, most of our high school respondents are in the first year of high school, and least of them are in the second year of high school. <br>
            <!--br is used for another paragraph/to break down the paragraph-->
            <br>
            As for where they spend their remaining allowance, it shows in our table & graphs that 32 respondents (64% of the sample) save their remaining allowance to their savings. Meanwhile, five respondents (10%) spend their remaining allowance on food, about 6% spend it on online shopping. 2 votes go to N/A which means that there is no money left for them after a week.

            <br> As seen from the table, the boundary with the highest frequency in this case ranges from 485.5-821.5 with a frequency of 26. This suggests that the amount of money high school students usually receive as allowance ranges from ₱485.5 - ₱821.5. Next ranges from ₱149.5 -₱ 485.5 with a frequency of 7. Next to that is the boundary that ranges from 821.5 - 1157.5 with a frequency of 6. The boundary after that ranges from 1493.5 - 1829.5 and has a frequency of 5. Then, we have the boundary ranging from 1829.5 - 2165.5 with a frequency of 3. Lastly, we have the boundaries that range from 1157.5 - 1493.5 & 2165.5 - 2500.5 in tie for the last place with a frequency of 2. <br>
           
           <br> For their total spendings in school, we can observe that the data/class boundary with the highest frequency of 21 is ₱-0.5 - ₱271.5, Dictatin that the amount high school students spend in school ranges from ₱-0.5 to ₱271.5. When ranked, the next is 271.5 - 543.5, followed by 543.5 - 815.5, then a tie from 815.5 - 1087.5 and 1631.5 - 1900.5, which is followed by 1359.5 - 1631.5, then finally 1087.5 - 1359.5 which a frequency of 0, suggesting that they don’t spend that amount of money.

            <h1> Conclusion</h1>
            <p> We found a lot of exciting information about our target audience, young adults aged 18-25 and high school students. According to our study, our target audience receives an average weekly allowance of 879 pesos. The majority of their allowance is spent on savings, followed by eating and then internet shopping. We also thought it was interesting that individuals regard video game and coffee money to be among the most unimportant expenses. <br>
            <br> Though we consider our research a success, we still have a few issues. One of our main issues is the vagueness of our target audience. As our target range is so wide, the information we present may not be the most accurate and exact. <br>
            <br>If we were to improve anything for future research, we recommend narrowing down our target audience. As it is one of our main issues, it would be much better to narrow it down to help us present correct and accurate data. I also recommend being more specific with the questions, to avoid any outliers in the data. Finally, in addition to focusing more narrowly on our target market, we also want to get more responses. More responses allow us to reduce the number of outliers while obtaining a wider range of responses. <br>
            <br> Through this activity, we learned the importance of data, and how statistics is the basis of all sciences. We realized that through data analysis, we can learn more about our society's functioning and popular preferences. Overall, statistics helps us make a conclusion on how to further improve our society and how we can move forward with it. </p> <br>
