        <h1> Study Background </h1>
        <p> High school is an important part of the lives of a nation’s youth. It embodies their education system and support system that could last years. But with financial limitations, this could also provide limits for students’ overall experience. In light of rising prices in our country, everyone is affected, from working employees to parents raising children to high school students, and so on. <br> 

            <br> This statistics research will show data on Filipino high schoolers’ weekly allowance and more specifications on what they spend it on. This can give us more insight and understanding of how high schoolers budget and prioritize their finances as a student in today’s economy. <br>
            <!--<br> is used for another paragraph/to go to next paragraph-->
                <br> In this study, we surveyed 50 high school students in Davao City on their grade level, weekly allowance, weekly school spendings, and where they spend their remaining money. Thus, for our qualitative variables, we present their grade level & where they spend their remaining money. As for the quantitative variables, we have their weekly allowance, and their weekly school spendings.
